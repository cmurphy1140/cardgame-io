# Catch 5: From Rule to Running Game

## Big Picture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Demo[SwiftUI table or text demo] --> Match[Match: whole game and scores]
    Match --> Hand[Hand: one deal and whose turn]
    Hand --> Bidding[Bidding: who wins the auction]
    Hand --> Tricks[Tricks: legal cards and trick winner]
    Hand --> Scoring[Scoring: points earned]
    Match --> Scoring
```

The screen sends an action, such as “Seat 0 plays the queen of clubs.” Match sends it to Hand. Hand checks turn order, card ownership and following suit. The fourth card resolves a trick. The sixth completed trick resolves a hand. Match then updates scores once, saves a hand summary and checks for a winner.

## Source-to-Test Connections

| Source | Direct tests | Whole-game connection |
|---|---|---|
| `Sources/CatchFive/Cards.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/TrickTests.swift` — cardValuesForGame | Captured values contribute to Game |
| `Sources/CatchFive/Bidding.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/BiddingTests.swift` | HandTests verifies winning dealer chooses trump; `calls` feeds the table's per-seat bid display |
| `Sources/CatchFive/Tricks.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/TrickTests.swift` | HandTests enforces following suit and next leader |
| `Sources/CatchFive/Scoring.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/ScoringTests.swift` | MatchTests checks actual hand and match totals |
| `Sources/CatchFive/Hand.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/HandTests.swift` | 208 repeatable hands; no duplicate or missing cards |
| `Sources/CatchFive/Match.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/MatchTests.swift` | Five full hands ending 26–16, then reject further play |
| `Sources/CatchFive/MatchSave.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/SaveTests.swift` | Resume during bidding, trump selection, a trick, or between hands |
| `Sources/CatchFive/ComputerPlayer.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/ComputerPlayerTests.swift` | 24 shuffled matches using only restricted observations, then save/load |
| `Sources/CatchFive/EasyPlayer.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/StrategyBenchmark.swift` | the frozen opponent the standard player must beat |
| `Sources/CatchFive/HandReview.swift` | `Tests/CatchFiveTests/ReviewTests.swift` | every play of a finished hand explained by rebuilding its view |
| `Sources/CatchFiveDemo/main.swift` | Run `swift run catch-five-demo` | Calls Match; does not maintain a separate score implementation |

## Follow One Test

`matchScoresOnlyAfterLastCardAndOnlyOnce` is a useful starting point:

1. Create a real Match with a fixed deck.
2. Send real bids and choose trump.
3. Play 23 legal cards; expect scores `[0, 0]` and no history.
4. Play card 24; expect scores `[2, 7]` and one hand summary.
5. Attempt another play; expect rejection and unchanged scores.

A fixed deck makes a failure repeatable. Small rule tests explain exactly which behavior broke; full-game tests catch pieces that work separately but are connected incorrectly.

## Where the rest lives

The SwiftUI table in `Sources/CatchFiveUI` (view model tested in `Tests/CatchFiveUITests`) plays full matches with automatic saving; [types-and-functions.md](types-and-functions.md) lists every type it adds. 9-and-out is wired through Match: it outranks a normal 9 and the dealer may match it to take the bid.


## Following Functions Without Xcode

Use VS Code or Cursor with the official Swift extension. Open the repository folder containing Package.swift, not an individual file. The Swift extension supplies Go to Definition, Peek Definition, Find All References and test/debugging support.

- **Go to Definition** answers “what does this function actually do?”
- **Find All References** answers “who uses this function?”
- **Outline / Go to Symbol** lists the functions and types in the current file.
- **Debugger Step Into** follows a call while a real scenario runs; **Step Over** runs a call without descending into it. Set a breakpoint in Match.play and debug a Match test.

Start with a scenario, not the alphabetic file list. Trace these exact calls:

```text
MatchTests.matchScoresOnlyAfterLastCardAndOnlyOnce
  -> playCards
    -> Match.play
      -> Hand.play
        -> Hand.legalMoves -> legalCards
        -> Hand.finishTrick (fourth card only)
          -> trickWinner
          -> scoreHand (sixth trick only)
      -> Match.recordHand (finished hand only)
        -> settle
```

Track three things at each call: its inputs, what state it changes, and its result/error. Most of our types are structs (value types); `mutating` means the method changes that value. `private(set)` lets other code read a property but makes its owner responsible for changing it.

## Save/Resume Path

```text
SaveTests.saveRestoresEveryPhaseAndContinuesIdentically
  -> MatchSave.encode -> versioned JSON: initial deck + accepted actions
  -> MatchSave.decode -> new Match
    -> SavedAction.apply -> ordinary bid / chooseTrump / play / startNextHand
  -> continue playing -> same final score
```

Disk connection: MatchSave.write uses atomic file replacement; MatchSave.read loads bytes and passes them to decode. Tests use a temporary directory and check replacing a save as well as reporting missing/unwritable paths.

Only successful actions enter the log. Replay rejects illegal actions and invalid decks. Format version 1 ties a save to the current rules/replay behavior; future incompatible rule changes need an explicit migration or version bump. Replay time grows with the number of actions, which is acceptable for this initial local game but should be measured for unusually long matches.

Run `swift run catch-five-demo --save-roundtrip` to watch the demo resume after three plays and continue to the same 26–16 finish.

## Computer Player Path

```text
ComputerPlayerTests.computersCompleteShuffledMatchesThroughRealRules
  -> PlayerView(match:seat:)       // copy only own cards and public information
  -> ComputerPlayer.decide         // select a strategy action
    -> bidAmount / preferredSuit / chooseCard
  -> Match.apply                   // referee still checks the proposed action
    -> Match.bid / chooseTrump / play
  -> normal scoring and victory
  -> save/load finished match
```

Responsibility: PlayerView answers “what can this player know?” ComputerPlayer answers “what should it try?” Match answers “is that action allowed, and what happens next?” These are deliberately separate. Bidding uses an expected-points estimate per suit. Card play builds a `Knowledge` value from the seat's cards and every card already played, then scores each legal card by expected points net of the control given up. Strength is measured by `StrategyBenchmark` against the frozen `EasyPlayer`. It does not attempt 9 and out.

Try `swift run catch-five-demo --computer` for a narrated match with fresh shuffled decks.


### UI audit preview (September 30, 2026)

`TableSurface.bidChoices(_:lowest:)` shares the numeric bid controls between the wide row and compact four-column grid. `bidding` chooses the fitting layout with `ViewThatFits`; action validation remains in the existing `actionButton`. `HandSummaryView.score` now labels total and per-hand change. These branch changes require native build and play verification; see D96.
