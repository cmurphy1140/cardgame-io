# Build and Run

## What kind of project this is

Catch 5 is a **Swift package** first and an **iOS app** second. A Swift package is a folder with a `Package.swift` manifest and `Sources/` and `Tests/` directories. The Swift toolchain builds and tests it from the command line with no IDE.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Package["Swift package (Package.swift)"]
        E["Sources/CatchFive<br/>rules engine<br/>(no UI imports)"]
        U["Sources/CatchFiveUI<br/>GameModel + SwiftUI views"]
        D["Sources/CatchFiveDemo<br/>terminal demo executable"]
        T1["Tests/CatchFiveTests"]
        T2["Tests/CatchFiveUITests"]
    end
    A["App/CatchFiveApp.swift<br/>@main entry, 9 lines"]
    E --> U --> A
    E --> D
    E --> T1
    U --> T2
```

`Package.swift` declares five targets. Read it as a dependency list: `CatchFiveUI` depends on `CatchFive`, the app depends on `CatchFiveUI`, and nothing depends on the app. The arrows in the diagram only ever point right; the engine never knows a screen exists.

One environment note: this repository lives under the iCloud-synced Desktop, so the folder carries the `com.apple.fileprovider.ignore#P` extended attribute (set September 13, 2026) to keep iCloud out of `.git` and the working tree. After cloning to a synced location, reapply it with `xattr -w 'com.apple.fileprovider.ignore#P' 1 <repo folder>`.

## The eight commands

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer swift test` | Compiles every target and runs the whole suite | After every change |
| `... swift test --filter <name>` | Runs one test by function name | While working on one rule |
| `... swift run catch-five-demo` | Plays a fixed five-hand match in the terminal and prints every trick | To watch the engine without the app. Add `--computer` for shuffled computer play, `--save-roundtrip` to see save/restore mid-trick |
| `... python3 scripts/build-simulator.py` | Produces `work/simulator-build/CatchFive.app` for the iOS simulator | To run the real app |
| `scripts/run-simulator.sh [device]` | Builds, boots the "Catch 5 iPhone" simulator (or the named one), installs and launches | To play the latest build in the simulator; IntelliJ's **Catch 5 Simulator** run configuration runs it |
| `scripts/install-phone.sh` | Builds signed, installs and launches on the connected iPhone | Every time you want the latest build on the phone, and weekly to renew a free-team install ([device-install.md](device-install.md)) |
| `python3 scripts/export-docs.py` | Renders every explainer page to PDF and every Mermaid diagram to PNG in `work/docs-export/` | To upload the pages to Claude Design or share them outside GitHub |
| `swift scripts/contrast-sample.swift <png> <x0> <y0> <x1> <y1> [label]` | Reports the contrast against ivory of a region of a simulator screenshot, sampling real pixels | To check a background that is drawn in code, where the colour literal is not what lands on screen |

`DEVELOPER_DIR` points the `swift` command at Xcode's toolchain rather than the command-line-tools copy, which lacks the iOS SDK.

## Why there is a Python build script

Normally `xcodebuild` (or Xcode's Run button) compiles an iOS app. It was once the case that this Mac had no iOS platform installed and `xcodebuild` could find no destination, which is why this script exists. That is no longer true, verified September 14 2026: `xcodebuild -showdestinations` lists simulators across iOS 26.5 and 27.0. The script is kept because it stays useful — it calls `swiftc` against the simulator SDK directly, needs no project file and no destination resolution, and builds the app in about twenty seconds.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1["xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path<br/>find the simulator SDK"] --> S2
    S2["swiftc -emit-library -static<br/>Sources/CatchFive/*.swift → libCatchFive.a + CatchFive.swiftmodule"] --> S3
    S3["swiftc -emit-library -static<br/>Sources/CatchFiveUI/*.swift → libCatchFiveUI.a"] --> S4
    S4["swiftc App/CatchFiveApp.swift -lCatchFiveUI -lCatchFive<br/>→ CatchFive.app/CatchFive executable"] --> S5
    S5["write Info.plist<br/>bundle id com.cardgame.catchfive, display name Catch 5"] --> S6
    S6["codesign --sign -<br/>ad-hoc signature the simulator accepts"]
```

Each `swiftc` call is the compiler invoked directly, with `-target arm64-apple-ios17.0-simulator` so the binary is built for the simulator, and `-swift-version 6`. The `-I` and `-L` flags tell later steps where to find the `.swiftmodule` and `.a` files from earlier steps.

`project.yml` and `CatchFive.xcodeproj` are what `scripts/install-phone.sh` builds from when the app goes to a real phone ([device-install.md](device-install.md)); `xcodegen` regenerates the project from the YAML. Neither is used by `build-simulator.py`, but that script does copy three things the store build also uses: the `App/Explainer` folder of bundled documentation pages, the icon, scaled from `App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/icon-1024.png` (rendered by `swift scripts/make-icon.swift <output>`), and `App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`.

## Toward the App Store

Everything the archive needs is in the repository: the asset catalog with a 1024-pixel alpha-free icon, the privacy manifest (no tracking, no required-reason APIs), and `project.yml` with the bundle id, version 1.0, the card-games category and the icon setting. Signing for a device works here: `scripts/install-phone.sh` built, signed, installed and launched on Connor's iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 27.0) with Xcode 27.0 on September 14 2026, on a free personal team, so the install stops opening after seven days. Archiving for the App Store is a different operation and has not been run:

```bash
xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -scheme CatchFiveApp -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' archive -archivePath work/CatchFive.xcarchive
```

Then upload the archive from Xcode's Organizer to TestFlight.

## Running on the simulator

The simulator named "Catch 5 iPhone" (UDID `02419047-584C-4D69-A0F1-6F33C2C5F0F2`) is the test device. `scripts/run-simulator.sh` does the whole trip in one step: build, boot, open the Simulator window, install, launch. In IntelliJ it is the **Catch 5 Simulator** run configuration, stored in `.run/` so it arrives with the repository. A device name or UDID as the argument picks another simulator, and `CATCH5_HEADLESS=1` skips the window. The two steps it ends with, from the terminal:

```bash
xcrun simctl install 02419047-584C-4D69-A0F1-6F33C2C5F0F2 work/simulator-build/CatchFive.app
```

```bash
xcrun simctl launch 02419047-584C-4D69-A0F1-6F33C2C5F0F2 com.cardgame.catchfive
```

The app saves to `Application Support/CatchFive/game.json` inside the simulator's container. Reinstalling keeps that file, so a game in progress survives a rebuild.

## What happens at launch

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant iOS
    participant App as CatchFiveApp (@main)
    participant GM as GameModel.loadDefault()
    participant Disk as game.json
    participant TV as TableView
    iOS->>App: start process
    App->>GM: build the model
    GM->>Disk: does a save exist?
    alt save exists and replays cleanly
        Disk-->>GM: Match rebuilt by replaying every action
    else missing or corrupt
        GM-->>GM: fresh Match, errorMessage explains if restore failed
    end
    App->>TV: TableView(model:)
    TV-->>iOS: first frame
    TV->>TV: .task(id: revision) decides if a computer should act
```

`@main` marks the one type the OS calls to start the app. The whole `App/CatchFiveApp.swift` file is nine lines because all behaviour lives in the package where it can be tested.

## Sharing the pages outside GitHub

GitHub renders these pages, Mermaid fences included. Claude Design does not: it imports documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX) and images, not Markdown or Mermaid. `scripts/export-docs.py` closes that gap by rendering every page and diagram from the Markdown source, so there is never a second copy to keep in step.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    MD["docs/*.md"] --> MMD["mermaid-cli<br/>one PNG per fence"]
    MMD --> PNG["diagrams/*.png"]
    MMD --> RW["Markdown with<br/>image links"]
    RW --> MK["marked"] --> HTML["HTML"] --> CH["headless Chrome"] --> PDF["*.pdf"]
    PNG --> RM["README.md<br/>file list + prompt"]
    PDF --> RM
```

Run it from the repo root as `python3 scripts/export-docs.py`. With no arguments it exports `learning-path` and every page linked from the reading-order table in [learning-path.md](learning-path.md), in table order, so adding a row to that table is all it takes to export a new page. Name pages to export only those (`python3 scripts/export-docs.py architecture game-flow`), and `--out DIR` changes the folder from the default `work/docs-export/`, which is gitignored.

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | What is in the folder and a paste-ready Claude Design prompt |
| `catch-five-explainer.pdf` | All pages in reading order as one document |
| `<page>.pdf` | One PDF per page, `learning-path.pdf` through `code-map.pdf` |
| `diagrams/<page>-<n>.png` | One PNG per Mermaid block, numbered in page order |
| `_build/` | Intermediates: the rewritten Markdown and the HTML that Chrome printed |

The script is stdlib Python that shells out to three tools already on this Mac, the same approach as `build-simulator.py`. mermaid-cli, run through `npx`, renders each diagram to PNG and rewrites the fence to an image link. marked, also through `npx`, turns the Markdown into HTML. Headless Chrome prints the HTML to PDF; the script finds it from the `CHROME` environment variable first, then puppeteer's cache, then `/Applications`. The first run may download marked. The script fails loudly if a tool is missing or if the PNG count differs from the number of Mermaid fences in the source pages.

To get the pages into Claude Design:

1. Run `python3 scripts/export-docs.py` from the repo root.
2. Open Claude Design.
3. Attach `work/docs-export/catch-five-explainer.pdf` and the PNGs from `diagrams/` you want redrawn, then paste the prompt from `work/docs-export/README.md`.

The app declares `UIUserInterfaceStyle` = Dark (in `project.yml` for Xcode builds and in `scripts/build-simulator.py` for the hand-built bundle), so the system-generated launch screen is dark and there is no white flash before the felt appears.
