# Game Flow

Seats are 0 (You), 1 (West), 2 (Partner), 3 (East). Team 0 is seats 0 and 2; team 1 is seats 1 and 3. Play moves in ascending seat order, wrapping at 4.

## A match

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Hand1: Match(deck:dealer:)
    Hand1 --> Settled: sixth trick scored once
    Settled --> NextHand: startNextHand(deck:)<br/>dealer rotates +1
    NextHand --> Settled: sixth trick scored
    Settled --> [*]: a team reaches 25<br/>or 9-and-out resolves
```

`Match.winner` becomes non-nil exactly once. After that every action throws `MatchError.matchFinished`. The screen asks for an explicit "Deal next hand" tap so the scoring breakdown can be read first.

## One hand: the four phases

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> bidding: deal 6 each,<br/>two packets of 3,<br/>left of dealer first
    bidding --> choosingTrump: dealer has acted<br/>(auction.nextSeat == nil)
    choosingTrump --> playing: bid winner names trump,<br/>everyone discards non-trumps<br/>and refills to 6
    playing --> playing: card played,<br/>4th card resolves the trick,<br/>winner leads
    playing --> finished: 6th trick →<br/>scoreHand → Match.recordHand
    finished --> [*]
```

`HandPhase` is the enum with these four cases. Every `Hand` method starts with a guard on `phase`, so calling `play` during `bidding` throws `HandError.wrongPhase` rather than doing something odd.

## The auction, turn by turn

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["nextSeat = dealer + 1"] --> B{"Is this seat the dealer?"}
    B -- no --> C{"Pass?"}
    C -- yes --> D["record AuctionCall(seat, nil)"]
    C -- no --> E{"bid ≥ highest + 1<br/>and 2…9?"}
    E -- no --> X["throw invalidBid<br/>turn is NOT consumed"]
    E -- yes --> F["highestBid = bid, winner = seat<br/>record AuctionCall"]
    D --> G["nextSeat += 1"]
    F --> G
    G --> B
    B -- yes --> H{"Anyone bid?"}
    H -- no --> I["dealer must bid 2<br/>(pass throws)"]
    H -- yes --> J["dealer may match highest,<br/>raise, or pass"]
    I --> K["nextSeat = nil<br/>phase → choosingTrump"]
    J --> K
```

Special bid: `nineAndOut` sets `highestBid = 9` and `isNineAndOut = true`. It outranks a normal 9. Only the dealer may bid against it, and only by matching with their own 9-and-out; that override was confirmed as a house rule on 2026-09-04. Normal bids after a 9-and-out throw.

After trump is named the table shows a one-line notice of how many cards the human discarded and drew, since the refill happens without a tap. It rides along in the undo toast for four seconds, then stands on its own until the human's next action. On screen the discards rise off the hand and fade, then the replacements deal in one by one from the deck in the corner, and the first computer lead waits for that to finish (D37).

`Auction.calls` is the ordered list of accepted calls. The table reads it to show "Bid 3" or "Pass" under each seat; computers receive it in `PlayerView.calls`.

## One trick

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant L as Leader
    participant H as Hand
    participant N as Next three seats
    L->>H: play(card) — the bidder's opening lead must be trump if held#59;<br/>every later lead is free
    loop three more plays
        N->>H: play(card)
        H->>H: legalMoves: must follow led suit if able,<br/>otherwise anything (trumping allowed)
    end
    H->>H: trickWinner: highest trump if any trump was played,<br/>else highest card of the led suit
    H->>H: captured[winner % 2] += all four cards
    H->>H: nextSeat = winner
    Note over H: on the 6th trick: scoreHand, phase = finished
```

On screen, each card arrives on the pile from its seat's side of the table (your own flies up from the hand). A finished trick stays for 900 ms with the winning card ringed in gold, then the four cards collapse toward the winner's seat; a small stack button beside the status line brings the last trick back for tap-to-explain.

## Scoring at the end of a hand

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C["captured cards<br/>per team"] --> HI["High: highest trump played → 1"]
    C --> LO["Low: lowest trump played → 1"]
    C --> J["Jack of trump, if played → 1"]
    C --> F["Five of trump, if played → 5"]
    C --> G["Game: 10=10 J=1 Q=2 K=3 A=4<br/>across all suits → 1<br/>tie → bidding team"]
    HI & LO & J & F & G --> P["HandScore.points [team0, team1]"]
    P --> S["settle(scores, points, bidder, bid)"]
    S --> R{"bidder made bid?"}
    R -- yes --> Y["bidder += its points"]
    R -- no --> N["bidder −= bid amount"]
    Y & N --> DEF["defenders += their points"]
    DEF --> W{"≥ 25?"}
```

High and Low are relative to cards actually played. Undealt cards stay in the stock and never count, which is why "Out of play" can appear for Jack or Five in the hand summary.

## Who acts when: the screen's scheduler

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    R["model.revision changed"] --> T[".task(id: revision) starts"]
    T --> Q{"human's turn,<br/>or hand/match over?"}
    Q -- yes --> STOP["do nothing; wait for a tap"]
    Q -- no --> H["hold a finished trick 900 ms,<br/>collapse it toward the winner"]
    H --> S["sleep Settings.delay:<br/>longer before a lead,<br/>relaxed / normal / quick"]
    S --> C{"task cancelled?<br/>(revision changed again)"}
    C -- yes --> STOP
    C -- no --> D["stepComputer():<br/>PlayerView → ComputerPlayer.decide → match.apply"]
    D --> R
```

Because `stepComputer()` increments `revision`, the next task starts automatically. The human's tap also increments it, which cancels any pending computer sleep, so nothing acts out of turn. The task's id also carries a pause flag from `TablePause`: while the pause card, any sheet, a dialog, the reopened last trick or an inactive scene covers the table, the flag flips, the task is cancelled, and nothing acts until every cover is gone, at which point one fresh task runs and applies at most one computer action. The decisions in the middle (hold or not, lead or follow, wait for the deal) come from `TableScheduler.plan`, a pure function with its own test.

## Your touch: from finger to accepted play

`HandFanView` turns one touch on a hand card into a refusal, a pick, a spring back or a play. Look at the two thresholds: a touch that moves 8 pt or less is a tap, and a drag has to travel 70 pt up to play. Only the gold boxes change the match; everything above them happens in the view.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T(["You touch a card"]) --> L{"legal now?"}
    L -- no --> SH["shakes, buzzes,<br/>says why;<br/>VoiceOver hears it"]
    L -- yes --> M{"moved more<br/>than 8 pt?"}
    M -- no --> P{"already picked?"}
    P -- no --> PK["picked: rises 30 pt,<br/>&quot;Tap again&quot;"]
    P -- yes --> PLAY["played: reports<br/>the card's launch pose"]
    M -- yes --> D{"dragged up 70 pt?"}
    D -- no --> SB["springs back"]
    D -- yes --> PLAY
    PLAY --> SEND["GameModel.send(.play)"]
    SEND --> AP["Match.apply validates"]
    AP --> SV["persist() saves game.json"]
    SV --> RV["revision + 1"]

## After every accepted action: the motion lane

Every accepted action starts two lanes; this one decides what the table animates. It holds view state only and never changes the match. Only one card played, one step forward, makes a card fly; anything that is not one step forward resets every card to where the match says it is.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    R(["accepted action:<br/>revision + 1"]) --> C["MotionSnapshot.change<br/>decides what changed"]
    C -- "one card<br/>played" --> RM{"Reduce Motion?"}
    RM -- yes --> FADE["it fades in,<br/>no flight"]
    RM -- no --> FP["FlightPlan: from<br/>your finger or<br/>the player's face"]
    FP --> FL["FlightLayer draws it<br/>in the air 0.42 s;<br/>the field hides it"]
    FL --> LAND["it lands and<br/>appears on<br/>the field"]
    C -- "next hand<br/>dealt" --> NH["none of it on<br/>the field yet"]
    C -- "a bid<br/>or trump" --> NF["nothing flies"]
    C -- "undo, new<br/>game or<br/>restore" --> RS["reset at once:<br/>every card where<br/>the match says"]
```

## After every accepted action: the scheduler lane

The other lane is `TableView.advance`, which decides when a computer acts. Read it top to bottom: each question is checked in turn, and the deal and the taking of a finished trick both run before any computer is asked to act. The gold boxes are the only place this lane changes the match, and their `revision + 1` starts both lanes again.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S(["revision changed:<br/>TableView.advance runs"]) --> P{"paused for a<br/>sheet or dialog?"}
    P -- yes --> W1["wait"]
    P -- no --> N{"new hand<br/>not dealt yet?"}
    N -- yes --> CAN{"no call yet, motion on,<br/>no pass-and-play curtain?"}
    CAN -- yes --> DEAL["deal from<br/>the dealer's deck"]
    CAN -- no --> SKIP["skip the deal,<br/>show the hand at once"]
    N -- no --> T{"finished trick<br/>not yet taken?"}
    DEAL --> T
    SKIP --> T
    T -- yes --> HOLD["hold 2 s, the winner<br/>ringed gold; gather<br/>0.26 s, take 0.44 s;<br/>the winner nods"]
    HOLD --> HF{"hand finished?"}

    HF -- no --> CMP{"a computer to act?"}
    T -- no --> CMP

    CMP -- yes --> STEP["bot beat 2 s,<br/>then stepComputer()"]

## How a computer chooses a card

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    V["PlayerView: my cards, trick, completed tricks"] --> K["Knowledge<br/>unseen = deck − mine − played"]
    K --> L{"Am I leading?"}
    L -- yes --> B{"Hold an unbeatable trump?"}
    B -- yes --> LB["lead it: pulls trumps,<br/>may force out the five"]
    B -- no --> NT{"No trumps left<br/>against us?"}
    NT -- yes --> LS["lead best side card"]
    NT -- no --> LX["cheapest exit,<br/>never the five"]
    L -- no --> S["for each legal card:<br/>p = chance our side wins the trick<br/>score = p·(table + stake) − (1−p)·stake − control"]
    S --> P["play the best score;<br/>ties → least control, lowest rank"]
```

The Hint button runs exactly this from your seat and shows the branch it took in words, ringing the suggested card. Tapping a card on the table or in the last trick rebuilds the view that seat had before playing it and shows the same explanation for that play. `stake` is the card's own point value if the other side captures it (a five is 5, a certain Low is 1, a ten is 0.6). `control` is what a trump is worth for later tricks, highest for an unbeatable one and zero on the last trick. `p` is 1 for an unbeatable card, otherwise 0.8 or 0.6 depending on how many seats still play, and when partner is winning it is the chance partner's card holds.

## After a hand, and after a match

"Review hand" rebuilds every play of the finished hand next to what the standard strategy would have done (the same reconstruction as tap-to-explain), with the plays that differ marked by a branch icon. Tapping the score bar lists every hand so far. When a team reaches 25, a match-over card shows the final score and the human's record, and one `MatchRecord` is appended to `history.json`; the chart button shows totals across all recorded matches.

## Undo

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    L["action log:<br/>bid, bid, bid, bid, trump, play(0), play(1), play(2), play(3), play(1)…"] --> P["undoPoint(forSeat: 0)<br/>index of seat 0's latest action this hand"]
    P --> R["rewound(toActionCount: index)<br/>replay the first deal through that prefix"]
    R --> S["save the shorter log,<br/>revision += 1"]
```

Undo is refused once the hand is scored and does not reach back into the previous hand.

## Saving

Every accepted action calls `persist()`, and `TableView` also calls it whenever the app leaves the foreground (`scenePhase` change). The write is atomic: the old file is replaced only when the new one is complete. `loadDefault()` reads it at launch; on failure the user sees an explanation and a fresh game.
